@Clarissa_xplain All kids under 13 should sit in the back. @NCPSB Aug 24, 2016 
@Clarissa_xplain It depends on the vehicle. Check the owner manual. Aug 24, 2016 
@Clarissa_xplain @NCPSB Smart! Yes, the back seat is much safer Aug 24, 2016 
RT @NCPSB: Dave Sander @EvenfloBaby will lead a discussion on the difference between high back and backless #booster seats. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A7: Read the vehicle & booster seat owner’s manuals for information about the use of booster seats with inflatable seat belts. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A7: Inflatable seat belts are generally compatible with booster seats. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A6: This includes properly restrained children. Read the vehicle owner’s manual for further information or any restrictions. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A6: Inflatable seat belts are designed to improve frontal crash protection for properly restrained occupants of all sizes. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A5: Side air bags need room to inflate, so children must be properly restrained and should not lean on the door or the window. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A5: There may be side air bags in rear seat cushions, door trim, quarter trim and in the area over the windows. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A5: There are currently no frontal air bags in rear seats. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A4: Unless the owner’s manual for the vehicle or car seat forbids it, it is okay to install a car seat next to a side air bag. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A4: Seat belts and child restraints help position the child away from the inflating side air bag. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A4: Do not allow children to lean or sleep against the door, the side windows or any area where a side air bag will inflate. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A4: Remind children not to place anything like books or toys, in the space between them and the door or window. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A4: Children should be properly restrained to avoid contact with a side air bag when it is inflating. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A4: These tests help reduce the risk that a child might be injured by an inflating side air bag. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A4: Side air bags are often tested with child-size dummies who are not properly seated. These are “out of position” tests. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A3: While the advanced passenger air bag is less likely to injure a child, it is not designed to restrain them in a crash. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A3: Sensors can be fooled, so front passengers must always sit up straight in the seat with their seat belt fastened. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A3: Sensors in the front passenger seat measure pressure or weight to decide the size of the front passenger. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A3: Most front passenger air bags are suppressed or inflate less forcefully when children are present in the front seat. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A3: Vehicle manufacturers test front air bag systems with child-size dummies, but children are safer in the back seat. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: Do not switch seat belt retractors to restrain children in booster seats or seat belts. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: Only switch retractors to the locking mode for installing child seats with harnesses. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: A seat belt should not rest on a person’s stomach or neck. It should rest on hips and shoulders. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: Remind children to keep their seat belt snug – not loose – across their lower hips and shoulder. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: If the back seat has a height adjuster for the upper seat belt anchorage, remember to adjust it to properly fit the child. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: Every passenger should ride in their own seat belt, sitting upright and forward-facing. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: Never allow children to share a seat belt. Never carry more passengers than the number of seat belts in your vehicle. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: Never allow children to lean against the door or window if the vehicle has side air bags. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: Children may be severely injured in a crash if they don’t wear the shoulder belt properly. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A2: Never allow children to slide the shoulder belt behind them or under their arm. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
#Safe2School https://t.co/HvlX4xdrdI Aug 24, 2016 
Position the vehicle seat in front of the shoulder anchorage so it is behind the child; not next to or in front of him/her. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A1: If an older child must sit up front using a FF child restraint or booster seat, move vehicle seat back as far as possible. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A1: According to @NHTSAgov, Children are more than twice as likely to be injured when they are in the front seat. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A1: If the front air bag cannot be shut off, only use rear-facing car seats in the back seat. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A1: NEVER place a rear-facing car seat in front of an active front passenger air bag. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016 
A1: Children 12 and under should always ride properly restrained in the rear seat. #Safe2School Aug 24, 2016

RT @NCPSB: Now let’s talk about the importance of tethers. #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A9: The @NCPSB Website has an easy-to-use list of weight limits for most brands: https://t.co/6fnvIXevjM #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A9: It’s safer to use the systems the way they were designed – lower anchors or seat belt, not both. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A9: Vehicle manufacturers can’t predict how lower anchors & seat belt would work together in a crash. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A9: Most car seats are also developed to be anchored with one or the other, but not both. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A9: The two anchorage systems were developed to be used independently. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A8: You must not use a car seat past its weight limit; vehicle anchors must not be used past theirs. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A8: Caregivers must follow both the car seat & the vehicle instructions including listed weight limits. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A8: Fitting the vehicle includes meeting all weight limits on the vehicle anchorages. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A8: The right car seat is one that “fits their vehicle.” #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A7: Some vehicle manufacturers ran their own tests to determine their tether anchor weight limits. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A7: The loading of a tether anchorage depends on its location in the vehicle. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A7: When the tether pulls on the anchorage during a crash, this is called “loading” the anchorage. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A7: Tether anchorages are not uniform. They are found in different locations in the vehicle. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A7: There isn’t a standard test for a combined child and car seat weight of over 65 pounds. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A6: Do not use both lower anchors and a seat belt to install a car seat. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A6: Use the sources we already listed to find out the weight limit for a specific vehicle. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
A6: Weight limits vary by vehicle manufacturer, model and model year. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
The tether anchorage weight limit may be higher when used with the seat belt to install a car seat. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
The weight limit for the LATCH system (lower anchors + tether) is usually 65 pounds. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
When in doubt, use the seat belt and tether to install the car seat instead of lower anchors. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
When weight limits conflict use the lower weight limit when installing the car seat in the vehicle. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
If none of the sources list a weight limit - assume it is 65 pounds, for the child plus car seat. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
Some manufacturers updated their #LATCH weight limits but didn’t reprint their manuals. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
Last, check the vehicle owner’s manual. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
Not all vehicle brands are listed on the website, so next check the most recent #LATCH Manual. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
Next, check the @NCPSB Website for a list: https://t.co/6fnvIXevjM #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
First look on the car seat label. New seats have the lower anchor weight limit on the label. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
The 65 pounds comes from about 45 pounds for the child and about 20 pounds for the car seat. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
Car seats in the late 1990s were lighter and had lower weight limits when LATCH was developed. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
The load on the vehicle lower anchorages comes from the combined weight of the car seat & child. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
Vehicle anchorage weight limits are just like car seat weight limits and should never be exceeded. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
High weight-limit car seats can weigh as much as an adult when used to their weight limits. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
LATCH anchorages are not designed to secure cargo or restrain larger occupants such as adults. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
LATCH anchorages are designed specifically to anchor child restraints to the vehicle. #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016 
Every safety device has usage limits, including vehicle child restraint anchorages (LATCH). #VehicleLATCH #childsafety Jan 21, 2016
